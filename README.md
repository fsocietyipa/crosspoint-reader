# CrossPoint Flibusta — X4 Pro

Custom firmware for the **Xteink X4 Pro**, based on
[XPoint](https://github.com/Belphemur/XPoint), which is a fork of
[CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader).

This branch adds an editable, anonymous **Flibusta** catalog preset at
`https://flibusta.is/opds`. Open **OPDS Browser** from Home, select Flibusta
(if you have other catalogs), browse or search, and fetch an EPUB to your SD card.
No API token or account is needed for the public catalog. The personal shelf is a
separate Flibusta feature that requires a login.

Includes XPoint's complete reading statistics: per-book and device totals,
sessions, reading time, pages turned, WPM, time-left estimates, daily history,
heatmap, current/best streaks, completion celebrations, and finished-book history.
Credits belong to XPoint, CrossInk, and YACP; these statistics are inherited,
not newly implemented by this branch.

**Download:** [X4 Pro Preview 1](https://github.com/fsocietyipa/crosspoint-reader/releases/tag/flibusta-x4pro-v2.3.0-1) (firmware + checksum).

**Installation, operation, limitations, and verification:**
[Custom firmware guide](docs/flibusta-x4pro.md).

Updates for this custom build use an **SD-card firmware file**. Online firmware
checks are disabled so an upstream release cannot replace the custom build.
The default build target is `x4pro-gh_release`:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
pio run -e x4pro-gh_release
```

The resulting application image is `.pio/build/x4pro-gh_release/firmware.bin`.
It is for the X4 Pro (ESP32-S3), not the original X4/X3 (ESP32-C3).

## ✨ Feature guide

### 📖 Reading experience

- **Reader engine**: EPUB 2/3 rendering with embedded-style option, image handling,
  hyphenation, kerning, adaptive table layouts, native CJK ruby annotations, chapter
  navigation, footnotes, bookmarks, go-to-percent, auto page turn, orientation control,
  focus reading, and more.
- **Dictionary on long-press or touch.** Long-press a word (or tap it on touch devices)
  to get the definition via [StarDict](docs/dictionary.md). No menu detour. The
  long-press action is configurable (dictionary, footnote, …).
- **Time left in the current chapter.** A live "47 min left" estimate in the status bar,
  computed from your real reading speed (220 wpm baseline, 15-sample trimmed mean,
  80–900 wpm clamps — Kindle's algorithm). Show it left, right, or hide it.
- **Formats**: native handling for `.epub`, `.xtc/.xtch`, `.txt`, and `.bmp`.
- **Tilt page turn** (X3 and Sticky).

### 📊 Reading statistics

A complete reading-statistics subsystem with a CrossInk-style card UI — full credit to
[@uxjulia](https://github.com/uxjulia)
([CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk)) for the original `BookStatsView`
design, and to [@Sichroteph](https://github.com/Sichroteph)
([YACP](https://github.com/Sichroteph/YACP)) for the Reading Rhythm, Reading
Achievement, and Finished Books screens and the screenshots above, which this fork
ports directly.

| | |
|---|---|
| <img src="./docs/images/yacp/media/reading-stats.png" width="264"><br>**Reading Stats** — per-book summary and this-device totals on one screen | <img src="./docs/images/yacp/media/reading-rhythm.png" width="264"><br>**Reading Rhythm** — daily intensity over the last 12 months, weekly reading time, reading days, current and best streaks |
| <img src="./docs/images/yacp/media/reading-achievement.png" width="264"><br>**Reading Achievement** — celebration screen when you finish a book | <img src="./docs/images/yacp/media/finished-books.png" width="264"><br>**Finished Books** — month-by-month history of completed books with dates and reading time |

- **Per-book and global stats**: sessions, reading time, pages turned, progress,
  reading speed (WPM), average session, reading streak, books read.
- **Reading speed (WPM)**: Kindle-style trimmed-mean tracker — 15-sample window,
  the two fastest and two slowest samples dropped, 80–900 wpm clamps.
- **Average session**: a 10-sample trimmed-mean session window, so one marathon
  (or an aborted glance) doesn't skew your average.
- **Reading Rhythm**: real minutes-per-day history (91 days) driving a daily
  intensity grid, weekly reading-time bars, and a 12-month reading-days chart.
- **Finished Books**: a bounded 32-book index on the SD card, grouped by finish
  month. Completed entries recover from your recent-books list — no SD scan.
- **Reading Achievement**: finishing a new book opens a celebration screen with
  the book's reading time, sessions, favorite reading period, and your device
  totals.
- **Edit dates**: fix a book's start/finish dates (and its completed state)
  directly from its stats screen.
- **End-of-book flow**: crossing the real end of a book completes it automatically;
  leaving while on the final page (or at ~100%) asks "Mark as Finished?" once —
  a decline is remembered until you read further, so a jump or trailing material
  never silently finishes a book.

### 🔤 Custom fonts

Your e-reader shouldn't dictate your typography. On PSRAM-equipped devices
(X4 Pro, M5PaperMono), XPoint ships a true vector font engine: take any `.ttf` or
`.otf` file — from Google Fonts, your OS, or that foundry you've been saving up for —
copy it to the SD card, and it just works. No firmware reflash, no rebuild, no
compromises.

1. Create a folder for your family on the SD card: `/fonts/YourFont/`
   (or `/.fonts/YourFont/` to keep it out of the way).
2. Drop in up to four styles: regular, bold, italic, bold-italic.
3. Select the family in the reader's font panel — done.

What makes it special:

- **Crisp at every size.** Glyphs are rasterized from vector outlines at render time,
  so you get true anti-aliased grayscale text at *any* point size — a continuous
  size picker, not a fixed list. Pixel-peep at 8pt or read at 24pt; it's sharp.
- **A real safety net.** A family missing a bold face or an exotic glyph? The reader
  silently falls back to the built-in font for just that piece — you never see
  missing-glyph boxes mid-sentence.
- **Instant previews.** The reader's font preview shows your current page full-screen;
  pick a family or set an exact size and the page re-typesets in place — try before you commit.
- **The whole toolkit keeps working.** Dictionary lookups, footnotes, CJK ruby
  annotations, focus reading, and hyphenation all run on your chosen font.
- **Up to 32 families** discoverable straight from the SD card, indexed on device.

Under the hood, font data lives in the X4 Pro's 8MB of PSRAM and rendered chapters
are cached on the SD card keyed to your exact font and settings — so switching fonts
only re-typesets what actually changed. (Curious about the engine? The design docs
live in [docs/design/ttf](./docs/design/ttf).)

#### How XPoint's TTF support differs from upstream CrossPoint

Both readers draw `.ttf`/`.otf`/`.ttc` files with the same FreeType engine, but
XPoint rebuilds the whole book-rendering pipeline around it (fractional metrics,
kerning, ligatures, anti-aliasing, cached sections) while upstream teaches its
old bitmap pipeline to draw TTF glyphs. Both now stream oversized fonts from the
SD card and fall back to your TTF font for CJK text in menus. Practical rule of
thumb: `.ttf` files work on both readers; `.cpfont` pre-rasterized families are
XPoint-specific. Details in [docs/ttf.md](./docs/ttf.md).

### 🏠 Home & library

- **Progress on every home card.** "42% • 2h 30m" right under each book in
  *Recent books*, so you can pick up where you left off without opening it.
  Same Kindle-WPM engine as the chapter timer.
- **Library workflow**: indexed title/author search, recently-added and alphabetical views, multilingual grouping, folder browser, recent books, and SD-cache management.

### 📡 Wireless

- File transfer web UI and WebSocket fast uploads
- EPUB Optimizer
- Web settings UI/API (edit many device settings from the browser)
- WebDAV handler
- AP mode (hotspot) and STA mode (join existing Wi-Fi), both with QR helpers
- Calibre wireless connect flow
- OPDS browser with saved servers (up to 8), search, pagination, and direct download
- OTA update checks and installs from GitHub releases
- KOReader progress sync

### ⚙️ Customization & hardware

- **Frontlight side-swipe gestures** (frontlight-equipped devices only): while reading,
  swipe vertically on the screen edges to control the frontlight — left edge adjusts
  color temperature (up = warmer, down = cooler), right edge adjusts brightness
  (up = brighter, down = dimmer). Sliding all the way down on the right edge turns the
  light off. Works independently of the "Touch Reader Controls" setting and can be
  toggled in *Settings → Display → Frontlight Side Gestures*.
- **Configurable Home button.** Short-press, double-click, and long-press are three
  independent bindings, each remappable in *Settings → Controls*.
- **Power button: short press sleeps, long press shuts down.** 400 ms hold = proper
  shutdown with cover screen + rail cut. Short press keeps its own binding and
  defaults to Sleep.
- **Auto power off.** After a configurable idle (default 4 h, range 2–12 h, "12 h" =
  Off) the device wakes on the RTC, paints a shutdown screen, and cuts the peripheral
  rail instead of draining in deep sleep. Next power press is a cold boot.
- **Customization**: night mode, multiple themes (Classic, Lyra, Lyra Extended,
  RoundedRaff), sleep screen modes including transparent overlays, front/side button
  remapping, status bar controls, refresh cadence, and more.
- **Localization**: 34 UI languages and counting, including CJK font fallback and
  RTL support.
- **Screenshots** and **tilt page turn** (X3 and Sticky).
- **USB Drive mode (X4 Pro)**: access the SD card as USB mass storage.

### 💾 Gentle on your SD card

**Smart progress saving — writes only when something changed.** Stock CrossPoint
writes your reading position to the SD card on *every single page turn*. XPoint
keeps your place in memory and persists it every two minutes only if you actually
moved — and always the instant you close the book, sleep, power off, or reach the
end of a book. The result: up to **20× fewer SD writes** during a reading session,
less card wear, and no page-turn lag — with at most 2 minutes of progress ever at
risk, and a low-battery mode that switches back to save-on-every-turn when it
matters most.

### 🔒 Signed OTA updates

Every release ships a `manifest.json` + Ed25519 signature. The device verifies against
a key baked into the firmware before flashing; corrupted or tampered updates are
rejected. Manual flashing still works. See [OTA signing](docs/OTA_SIGNING.md).

### 🔜 Coming soon

More themes. Web plugins. Bluetooth pageturner. Much more — stay tuned.

## USB-locked devices (Xteink Unlocker)

Some Xteink units purchased from third-party stores (e.g. AliExpress) ship with USB
flashing locked from the factory. If your device is locked, you will need to use the
**Xteink Unlocker** tool available at https://crosspointreader.com/#unlock-tool before
you can flash CrossPoint.

**You do not need this tool if you bought your device directly from xteink.com.** Those
units are not locked.

**Not sure if your device is locked?** Power it on, connect the USB-C cable, and try
flashing via the web flasher first (see [Install firmware](#install-firmware) below). If
the browser's serial device picker does not show your device, try a different USB port
or browser before assuming the device is locked. Only reach for the unlocker if the
device still doesn't appear.

> ### ⚠️ WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE USING THE UNLOCKER ⚠️
>
> **The only officially supported firmwares in the unlock tool are CrossPoint and
> CrossInk.**
>
> Flashing any other firmware on a USB-locked device may **permanently brick the
> device** or leave it **permanently stuck on that firmware with no recovery path**.
> Once USB flashing is re-locked, your only way back is via OTA, and if the firmware
> you flashed doesn't support OTA, **there is no way out**.

## Install firmware

### Web installer (recommended)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select your device (X3, X4,
   Xteink X4Pro, Seeed reTerminal Sticky, or M5PaperMono), and choose an official
   CrossPoint release.

### Web installer (specific version)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Download the firmware file for your device from
   [Releases](https://github.com/Belphemur/XPoint/releases), or compile yourself.
3. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select your device, click
   "Custom .bin" and upload the firmware file.

### Revert to Official Firmware

To revert to the official firmware, you can also flash the latest official firmware
using https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools.

### Command line

1. Install [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool):

```bash
pip install esptool
```

2. Download the firmware file for your device from the
   [releases page](https://github.com/Belphemur/XPoint/releases).

## Development quick start

### Prerequisites

- [pioarduino PlatformIO Core](https://github.com/pioarduino/platformio-core) or
  [VS Code + pioarduino IDE](https://github.com/pioarduino/pioarduino-vscode-ide)
- Python 3.8+
- `clang-format` 21
- USB-C cable supporting data transfer

### Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Belphemur/XPoint
cd XPoint

# if cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can enter the development shell with either `nix develop` (flakes) or
`nix-shell`:

```bash
nix develop -f nix
# or
nix-shell nix
```

To flash a connected ESP32-C3 device, enable PlatformIO's udev rules in your NixOS
configuration:

```nix
services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ platformio-core.udev ];
```

After rebuilding the system configuration, reconnect the device or reload udev rules.

### Build / flash / monitor

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### Contributor pre-PR checks

```bash
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check -e default
pio run -e default
```

### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it's recommended to capture detailed logs from the
serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```

After that run the script:

```sh
# For Linux
# This was tested on Debian and should work on most Linux systems.
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# For macOS
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```

Minor adjustments may be required for Windows.

## Internals

CrossPoint Reader is pretty aggressive about caching data down to the SD card to
minimise RAM usage. The ESP32-C3 only has ~380KB of usable RAM, so we have to be
careful. A lot of the decisions made in the design of the firmware were based on this
constraint.

### Data caching

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card.
Subsequent loads are served from the cache. This cache directory exists at
`.crosspoint` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:

```text
.crosspoint/
├── epub_<hash>/         # one directory per book, named by content hash
│   ├── progress.bin     # reading position (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # generated cover image
│   ├── book.bin         # metadata: title, author, spine, TOC
│   ├── css_rules.cache  # parsed CSS rule cache
│   ├── img_*            # rendered image cache files
│   ├── stats_v8.bin     # per-book reading statistics
│   └── sections/        # per-chapter layout cache
│       ├── 0.bin
│       ├── 1.bin
│       └── ...
├── settings.json        # device settings
├── state.json           # resume/runtime state
├── recent.json          # recent books list
├── global_stats.bin     # all-books reading statistics (407-byte versioned record)
└── finished_books.bin   # index of completed books (32 entries)
```

Removing `/.crosspoint` clears all cached metadata and forces a full regeneration on
next open. Book deletes, overwrites, and moves done through the firmware or web UI
clear or re-key matching caches; manual SD-card edits may leave stale cache directories
behind.

For more details on the internal file structures, see the
[file formats document](./docs/file-formats.md).
